KNOWN ISSUES for ai8x-training with PyToch 2.3.0
================================================

* As of PyTorch 2.3.0, torch.compile() requires CUDA.

* Using CUDA, certain models cause PyTorch 2.3.0 to print the following warning during training:

  .../graph.py:744: UserWarning: Plan failed with a cudnnException: CUDNN_BACKEND_EXECUTION_PLAN_DESCRIPTOR: cudnnFinalize Descriptor Failed cudnn_status:
  CUDNN_STATUS_NOT_SUPPORTED (Triggered internally at ../aten/src/ATen/native/cudnn/Conv_v8.cpp:919.)

  This should be addressed in PyTorch 2.3.1 (see https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/121834)
